# VSD-RISC-V-SoC-Tapeout-Program-Week-5

> *Transitioning from Transistor-Level Design to Full Physical Implementation*

---

## üöÄ Overview

This week‚Äôs task focuses on **setting up OpenROAD Flow Scripts** and executing the **Floorplan** and **Placement** stages of a standard **Physical Design flow**.
You‚Äôll move from SPICE-level design (Week 4) to actual **chip layout generation**, bridging theory and practice in VLSI backend design.

---

## üß© Objective

* Set up **OpenROAD Flow Scripts** on Linux.
* Run and verify **Floorplan** and **Placement** stages only.
* Understand how RTL is converted into a **physical representation** on silicon.

---

## üß± Why This Task Is Important

This task connects your transistor-level understanding with real-world chip implementation.
You‚Äôll learn:

‚úÖ How **core area** and **die dimensions** are defined
‚úÖ How **standard cells** are arranged to optimize **timing, area, and congestion**
‚úÖ How **floorplanning and placement** decisions influence overall **chip performance**

## üßÆ Execution Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Floorplan

* Defines **core area**, **die boundaries**, and **placement rows**.
* Establishes **power grid** and **IO ring** positions.

Command example:

```bash
./flow.tcl -design <design_name> -to floorplan
```

**Key Output Files:**

* `floorplan.def`
* `floorplan.log`
* `floorplan.png`

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Placement

* Standard cells are placed **legally** (non-overlapping).
* Aims to **minimize wirelength** and **optimize timing**.

Command example:

```bash
./flow.tcl -design <design_name> -from floorplan -to placement
```

**Key Output Files:**

* `placement.def`
* `placement.log`
* `placement.png`

---

## üñºÔ∏è Example Outputs

üì∏ **Expected Screenshots for Submission**

* Terminal showing commands & successful installation
* Floorplan view (core + die outlines)
* Placement layout (standard cells visible)

## ‚ùì Q&A Section

**Q1: Why stop at placement and not proceed to routing?**
‚û°Ô∏è Because routing is part of the next stage. Week 5 focuses only on *physical structure organization* before wires are connected.

**Q2: Can OpenROAD handle large designs?**
‚û°Ô∏è Yes! It supports both academic and industrial-scale designs.

**Q3: What‚Äôs the difference between Floorplan and Placement?**
‚û°Ô∏è Floorplan defines *where* cells can go; Placement decides *exactly where* each cell will go.

**Q4: What is ‚ÄúLegalization‚Äù in placement?**
‚û°Ô∏è It‚Äôs the process of adjusting cells to non-overlapping positions without violating rules.

**Q5: What‚Äôs next after Placement?**
‚û°Ô∏è Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS), Routing, and Signoff.
